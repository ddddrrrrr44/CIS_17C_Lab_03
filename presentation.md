# Lecture 03: Linked Lists

## Agenda
1. Introduction to Linked Lists
2. Node-based Structures
3. Basic Operations: Insert, Delete, Search
4. List Reversal Algorithm
5. Memory Management

## Key Concepts
- Dynamic vs Static Data Structures
- Pointer Manipulation
- Time Complexity Analysis
- Memory Leaks Prevention

## Code Examples
- Node creation and linking
- Insertion algorithms
- Traversal and search
- Reversal implementation

## Advantages over Arrays
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertions/deletions
- No fixed capacity

## Common Operations
- Insert: O(1) at head, O(n) at tail
- Delete: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Reverse: O(n)
